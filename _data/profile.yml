  <p>
    My English name is Kaimana C.Y. Xie. I was born on June 8, 1998, in Shenzhen, China. Currently, I am studying in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.
  </p>
  <p>
  
    I am pursuing a Master of Science in Pharmacy at Southern Medical University (SMU) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.nfyy.com/gcp/pi/a_107198.html" target="_blank">Prof. Zhongyuan Xu</a>, 
    the Director of the <a href="https://www.nfyy.com/gcp/" target="_blank">Center for Drug Clinical Research (GCP)</a> and the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Eh9KubkswABMVri5JCWD0wat" target="_blank">Clinical Pharmacy Center </a>Nanfang Hospital. My focus is on understanding and addressing the challenges of drug resistance and radioresistance in glioblastoma. My work involves designing and constructing nanodelivery systems, such as liposomes, to achieve targeted drug delivery for brain tumors, aiming to overcome the radiotherapy resistance associated with glioblastoma.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, my studies and research take place in the Center for Drug Clinical Research (GCP) and Clinical Pharmacy Center at Nanfang Hospital, where I participate in various clinical trial studies. In different projects, I have been involved in multiple aspects, including subject education and enrollment screening, drug administration, blood sample processing, and subject follow-up.
