    <h5 class="card-title">Development of a radiotherapy resistant stem cell model in glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines through repeated radiation screening: Isolation, identification, and investigation of resistance mechanisms</h5>

      The project has been completed, and the manuscript is being prepared...

      In this study, I established a radioresistant glioblastoma cell line. The specific approach involved isolating <code>glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs)</code> from the U87 cell line and treating the GSCs with a 5 Gy dose of radiotherapy, selecting for surviving cells, a process that was repeated 13 times. Ultimately, a radioresistant GSC cell line was obtained. Validation showed that this cell line highly expresses several stem cell markers, such as CD133 and SOX2.

      To further simulate the role of GSCs within the tumor, I induced <code>differentiation</code> in the GSCs. The differentiated cells were named Diff cells. Through in vitro validations, including cell viability assays and apoptosis tests, I found that Diff cells exhibited a significantly greater insensitivity to radiotherapy compared to U87 cells. Additionally, I discovered that Diff cells demonstrated markedly lower sensitivity to TMZ compared to U87 cells, suggesting a possible link between radioresistance and drug resistance.

     Finally, I performed whole transcriptome sequencing on U87, GSCs, and Diff cells for bioinformatics analysis, laying the foundation for subsequent research.
